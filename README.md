## Features Overview

### **Dynamic Form Generator**
- Generates forms dynamically based on a JSON schema.
- Supports multiple field types (text, email, select, radio, checkbox, etc.).
- Real-time validation for required fields, patterns, min/max values, and more.

### **JSON Editor**
- Syntax highlighting using `AceEditor`.
- Real-time validation with error messages for invalid JSON.
- Clipboard functionality to copy JSON schema.

### **Dark Mode**
- Toggles the theme between light and dark modes.
- Applies styling across the entire app.

### **Example JSON Schema**

Below is an example JSON schema that defines a user registration form. This schema can be used in the JSON editor to dynamically generate the form in the app.

```json
{
  "formTitle": "User Registration Form",
  "formDescription": "Please fill out the form to register.",
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "username",
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Username",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter your username"
    },
    {
      "id": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "label": "Email Address",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "you@example.com",
      "validation": {
        "pattern": "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$",
        "message": "Please enter a valid email address"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "password",
      "type": "password",
      "label": "Password",
      "required": true,
      "placeholder": "Enter a secure password"
    },
    {
      "id": "dob",
      "type": "date",
      "label": "Date of Birth",
      "required": false
    },
    {
      "id": "gender",
      "type": "radio",
      "label": "Gender",
      "required": true,
      "options": [
        { "value": "male", "label": "Male" },
        { "value": "female", "label": "Female" },
        { "value": "other", "label": "Other" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "hobbies",
      "type": "checkbox",
      "label": "Hobbies",
      "required": false,
      "options": [
        { "value": "reading", "label": "Reading" },
        { "value": "traveling", "label": "Traveling" },
        { "value": "sports", "label": "Sports" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "bio",
      "type": "textarea",
      "label": "Short Bio",
      "required": false,
      "placeholder": "Tell us about yourself..."
    },
    {
      "id": "profilePicture",
      "type": "file",
      "label": "Upload Profile Picture",
      "required": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Generated Form Preview**

Using the above schema, the following form will be generated:

1. **Text Input**: Username
2. **Email Input**: Email Address (validated for correct email format)
3. **Password Input**: Secure password
4. **Date Input**: Date of Birth
5. **Radio Buttons**: Gender selection
6. **Checkboxes**: Hobby selection
7. **Textarea**: Short Bio
8. **File Input**: Upload a profile picture

---

### **How to Use the Example Schema**

1. Copy the schema into the **JSON Editor** in the app.
2. Edit the JSON as needed for your form.
3. The form will dynamically update in the **Form Preview** section.

### Project Introduction

I have built a **Dynamic Form Generator** as part of the challenge. The project includes all the required features and some bonus features for a better experience.

You can explore the project here:  
- **[GitHub Repository](#)**  
- **[Live App](#)**  
- **[Documentation](#)** ([Read the Docs](#))

---

### How It Works

#### **Split-Screen Feature**
The application is divided into two parts:  
1. **JSON Editor**: This is where users can input or edit JSON.  
2. **Form Generator**: This creates a form based on the JSON provided.

---

#### **JSON Editor**
To make editing JSON easy and visually appealing, I chose to use the **ACE Editor**. This editor highlights the JSON format and makes it look cleaner compared to a simple `TextArea`.  

Hereâ€™s how it works:  
- **Error Handling**: If the JSON has errors, the ACE Editor shows those errors immediately.  
- **Valid JSON**: If the JSON is correct, it is sent to the **Form Generator**.

---

#### **Form Generator**
The Form Generator takes the valid JSON and creates a form based on it.  
- It checks the structure of the JSON to decide how each field should look and behave.  
- After filling out the form, the submitted data is saved in the application, and the user can **download the data** for future use.

---

#### **Responsive Design**
The app is built using **Tailwind CSS**, which ensures it works well and looks good on all devices, whether itâ€™s a phone, tablet, or desktop.

---

### Key Features
- **Easy JSON Editing** with real-time error detection.  
- **Dynamic Form Creation** based on the input JSON.  
- Option to **download submitted data**.  
- **Responsive Design** for all screen sizes.  
- **Clean and user-friendly interface** with ACE Editor.

This project is designed to be simple, effective, and easy to use, meeting all the challenge requirements and adding extra features to make it even better.
